Navigation Bars
A navigation bar is a navigation header that is placed at the top of the page:

Basic Navbar
With Bootstrap, a navigation bar can extend or collapse, depending on the screen size.

A standard navigation bar is created with the .navbar class, followed by a responsive collapsing class: .navbar-expand-xxl|xl|lg|md|sm (stacks the navbar vertically on xxlarge, extra large, large, medium or small screens).

To add links inside the navbar, use either an <ul> element (or a <div>) with class="navbar-nav". Then add <li> elements with a .nav-item class followed by an <a> element with a .nav-link class:

Link 1
Link 2
Link 3
